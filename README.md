# NeoMacro RefreshCache

NeoMacro RefreshCache is a simple extension which uses Magento Cron capabilities to
automatically refresh all cache types in Magento.

You must have Magento Cron properly set or this extension will not work.

Beware: This project is still in a very early stage. So, it may contain bugs and, of course, many limitations.
