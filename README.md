# NeoMacro Magento RefreshCache

NeoMacro Magento RefreshCache is a simple extension which uses Magento Cron capabilities to
automatically refresh all cache types in Magento every time cron runs.

You must have Magento Cron properly set or this extension will not work.

Beware: This project is still in a very early stage. So, it may contain bugs and, of course, many limitations.

Contributions, bug reports and suggestions are welcome!
